# FinnWalks - Automated Integration Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the automated integration testing strategy for the FinnWalks dog-walking scheduler application. The testing framework is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of all major features and flows in the application.

## Testing Framework & Tools

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Browser Emulation**: Happy DOM
- **Testing Libraries**:
  - @testing-library/react - For rendering and testing React components
  - @testing-library/user-event - For simulating user interactions
  - MSW (Mock Service Worker) - For mocking API requests

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into several categories:

### 1. Component Tests
Tests that verify individual components render correctly and respond to user interactions:

- `Home.test.tsx` - Tests for the main application page
- `Schedule.test.tsx` - Tests for schedule display and interaction
- `BookingModal.test.tsx` - Tests for booking form functionality
- `Leaderboard.test.tsx` - Tests for leaderboard display

### 2. API Tests
Tests that verify the API endpoints work correctly:

- `api.test.ts` - Tests for all backend API routes

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Tests that verify complete user flows:

- `e2e.test.tsx` - Tests for the complete booking and cancellation flow

### 4. Performance Tests
Tests that verify the application can handle load:

- `performance.test.ts` - Tests concurrent API requests and rapid booking/cancellation

## Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
npx vitest run
```

To run a specific test file:
```bash
npx vitest run tests/Home.test.tsx
```

To run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npx vitest
```

## Test Coverage Matrix

### Core Features Tested

| Feature | Component Tests | API Tests | E2E Tests | Performance Tests |
|---------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| View Schedule | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Book Walk | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cancel Walk | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View Leaderboard | ✓ | ✓ | - | - |
| Week Navigation | ✓ | - | ✓ | - |
| Walker Search | ✓ | ✓ | - | ✓ |
| Mobile View | ✓ | - | - | - |

### Tested Scenarios

1. **Schedule Viewing**
   - View schedule for current week
   - Navigate between weeks
   - View details of scheduled walks

2. **Booking Process**
   - Open booking modal
   - Enter walker information
   - Select available time slot
   - Submit booking form
   - View confirmation
   - Handle validation errors

3. **Cancellation Process**
   - Open cancellation modal
   - Confirm cancellation
   - Handle errors

4. **Leaderboard**
   - View all-time leaderboard
   - View next-week leaderboard
   - Switch between leaderboard views

5. **Error Handling**
   - Server errors
   - Validation errors
   - Network failures

6. **Performance**
   - Concurrent API requests
   - Rapid booking and cancellation
   - Handling multiple users

## Mocking Strategy

We use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept network requests and provide mock responses. This approach allows us to:

1. Test components in isolation without a running server
2. Simulate various server responses including errors
3. Create deterministic test scenarios

Mock data is defined in `tests/mocks/handlers.ts`.

## Test Utilities

Common testing utilities are available in `tests/utils.tsx` which provides:

1. Custom render function with providers (React Query, Router)
2. Helper functions for common testing tasks

## Future Test Enhancements

1. Expand coverage for edge cases
2. Add visual regression tests
3. Add load testing for high-volume scenarios
4. Add accessibility testing
