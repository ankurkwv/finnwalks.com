iOS (Safari/WebKit) will only offer to autofill a phone number when all of the following are true:

There’s a real <input type="tel"> in a <form> with browser autofill enabled.

That <input> has a name (or at least an autocomplete) attribute specifying that it’s a telephone field.

Your own contact card is selected in Settings → Siri & Search → My Information.

By default, react-phone-number-input/input renders a native <input type="tel"> (so the type is correct), but:

It does not set any name or autocomplete attributes for you.

You’re not wrapping it in a <form> with autofill enabled, so Safari never hooks into your modal’s fields.

1. Wrap in a real <form> with autoComplete="on"
Currently you’re just rendering <DialogContent> and intercepting clicks manually. Instead, use a <form>:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<DialogContent className="sm:max-w-md">
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} autoComplete="on">
    {/* … your fields … */}
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <Label htmlFor="walker-phone">Phone Number</Label>
      <div className="phone-input-container border rounded-md p-2 flex items-center bg-white">
        <PhoneInput
          id="walker-phone"
          name="tel"                    // ← crucial
          autoComplete="tel"            // ← crucial
          placeholder="(555) 555-5555"
          value={phone}
          onChange={(value) => setPhone(value || "")}
          className="w-full focus:outline-none"
          country="US"
          style={{ border: "none", width: "100%", height: "24px" }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>

    <Button type="submit">Book Walk</Button>
  </form>
</DialogContent>
Why this matters
• Browsers only autofill fields inside a <form> marked eligible for autocomplete (here, autoComplete="on").
• The name="tel" (or autocomplete="tel") tells Safari “this is a phone‐number field, please pull from Contacts.”

2. Pass the attributes through to the underlying <input>
If for some reason you can’t add them directly, react-phone-number-input will forward unknown props onto its <input>:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<PhoneInput
  inputProps={{
    name: "tel",
    autoComplete: "tel"
  }}
  placeholder="(555) 555-5555"
  value={phone}
  onChange={(value) => setPhone(value || "")}
  country="US"
/>
All other props you pass (like name or autoComplete) will be handed off to the <input> element itself. 
npm

3. Double‑check your user settings
Finally, on your iOS device:

Go to Settings → Siri & Search → My Information and make sure your own contact is selected.

If you’ve recently received an SMS 2FA code, iOS may prioritise that suggestion for a while; deleting the code or restarting Safari will restore the contact’s phone number suggestion.

Once you’ve done that, focus on the phone field and you should see your number appear above the keyboard as an autofill suggestion.
